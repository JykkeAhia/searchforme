2. Build images 
cd backend folder
do "docker build -t "backend" ."
cd frontend folder
do "docker build -t "frontend" ."

3. To run docker compose
cd backend folder
do "docker compose up" do not detach so you can see console output of docker compose up for errors etc.

4. Browse to http://localhost:8000

5. You can see parts of the api at http://localhost:8000/api

6. Django admin backend is at http://localhost:8000/admin and username and password are admin
