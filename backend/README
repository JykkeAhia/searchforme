--- With docker in wsl2 or Linux environment
Pre:
Image has this versionm of Google Chrome 91.0.4472.114 should not be a problem

https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=114.0.5735.90/ is what we have in dev wsl2 

So for dev reasons we will install chromedriver on backend root folder so we can use that 

1. Dockerd must be running 
-> (in wsl2 window do sudo dockerd and leave it to show logs)

1. build docker image in backend folder where there is Dockerfile present
docker build -t "backend" .
docker image ls 
-> should show the new image

2. run the docker backend image
docker run -p 8000:8000 backend

3. Try to access at http://localhost:8000/api 
or /admin -> admin:admin 

--- Or run normally in wsl2 environment
Pre:
Chrome maybe should be the same as in the container 

1. install pip and python 3.8.10 
2. in backend folder pipenv shell 
3. pip install --upgrade -r ./requirements/base.txt
4. python manage.py migrate
5. python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Try to access at http://localhost:8000/api 
or /admin -> admin:admin
