FAST: in repo root run ./RUNME.sh will build and docker compose up the project

The idea of this weird set of code is to demo different things for a job interview. It has no other purpose. 

Docker is here used only for development enviroment - and mainly as an easy way to demo. 

Pre:
1. Docker must be in use 
- in wsl2 do sudo dockerd to run dockerd
- in linux just make sure docker is installed normally
Tested on wsl2 docker version is the following:
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           24.0.2
 API version:       1.43
 Go version:        go1.20.4
 Git commit:        cb74dfc
 Built:             Thu May 25 21:52:22 2023
 OS/Arch:           linux/amd64
 Context:           default
And Docker Compose version v2.18.1

2. Build images 
cd backend folder
do "docker build -t "backend" ."
cd frontend folder
do "docker build -t "frontend" ."

3. To run docker compose
cd backend folder
do "docker compose up" do not detach so you can see console output of docker compose up for errors etc.

4. Browse to http://localhost:3000

5. You can see parts of the api at http://localhost:8000/api

6. Django admin backend is at http://localhost:8000/admin and username and password are admin

7. If you like you can edit both backend and frontend files and save and services should update automatically

8. Nice thing here is that you don't need to have correct version of anything. Only that you have working docker. 
Note that since docker containers are linux based and the filesystems of container and host are linked by docker compose up. You should use wsl2 or real linux distro and run docker compose up there.
