The idea of this weird set of code is to demo different things for a job interview. It has no other purpose. 

Pre:
1. Docker must be in use 
- in wsl2 do sudo dockerd to run dockerd
- in linux just make sure docker is installed normally
Tested on wsl2 docker version is the following:
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           24.0.2
 API version:       1.43
 Go version:        go1.20.4
 Git commit:        cb74dfc
 Built:             Thu May 25 21:52:22 2023
 OS/Arch:           linux/amd64
 Context:           default
And Docker Compose version v2.18.1

2. Build images 
cd backend folder
do "docker build -t "backend" ."
cd frontend folder
do "docker build -t "frontend" ."

3. To run docker compose
cd backend folder
do "docker compose up" do not detach so you can see console output of docker compose up for errors etc.

4. Browse to http://localhost:8000

5. You can see parts of the api at http://localhost:8000/api

6. Django admin backend is at http://localhost:8000/admin and username and password are admin

7. If you like you can edit both backend and frontend files and save and services should update automatically
